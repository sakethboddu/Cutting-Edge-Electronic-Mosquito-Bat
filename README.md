# Cutting-Edge-Electronic-Mosquito-Bat
input AC voltage
rectifier is used to convert into DC and decreases maximum input voltage minimum input voltage 
Charging cicuit - BOTH AC and DC supply can be work to charge the bat 
Transistor circuit - is used to amplify the input voltage
Voltage doubler circuit - is used to double the input voltage to rpovide sufficient to produce electricity to mesh
